        <p>My hobbie is soccer - Soccer Is My Hobby Because It’s Part of My Happiness Everybody has different hobbies that he or she would like to do for fun or relaxation and they can be either physical activities like soccer, swimming, basketball or it can be mental activities like reading, playing video games.
            For me soccer is my favorite hobby because it’s part of my life and I cannot live without it and sometimes I get my motivation through watching a soccer game when my team is losing but they comeback during the game to score more goals and win before at the last minute, then I feel like I can do it too and it’s never too late.
